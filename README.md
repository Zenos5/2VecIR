# 2VecIR
Doc2vec, formula2vec, and 2VecIR models and empirical results for using text and formula vectors to rank answers to math questions.

## Repository Structure
- Word2vec: where code for all of the models are stored
  - doc2vec: where source code is stored
    - checkpoints: where checkpoints for the model are saved to
        - d2v_CBOW: where checkpoint for pretrained doc2vec model is stored
        - f2v_CBOW: where checkpoint for pretrained formula2vec model is stored
