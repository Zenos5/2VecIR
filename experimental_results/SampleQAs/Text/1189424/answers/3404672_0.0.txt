A different definition of gcd affords another proof.

For , then  

Note that in some cases, an exponent  will be  when a particular  is not a factor of one or another of , but since \mid abc, at least one of  will be greater than 

Similarly, \gcd(a,b)=\prod ^{\min(\alpha_i,\beta_i)}

Hence, \gcd(\gcd(a,b),c)=\prod ^{\min({\min(\alpha_i,\beta_i)},\gamma_i)}=\prod ^{\min()}=\gcd() QED
