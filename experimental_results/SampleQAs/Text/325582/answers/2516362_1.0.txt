x^\frac{1}{2.4} =x^\frac{5}{12} = ()^\frac{1}{3}

 
Thus, assuming you have access to square root, you can calculate  precisely, and thus you only need a good approximation to cube root in the range 0 to 1.

As noted, there are multiple ways one can do such an approximation. For example, use Newton-Raphson to quickly converge to a solution; one can get this to run faster by pre-calculating some values at intervals and caching them, so one can converge faster to the result by looking up the nearest starting point.
