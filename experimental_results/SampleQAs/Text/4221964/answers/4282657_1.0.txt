&gt; 
&gt; Square-rooting both sides:
&gt; 
&gt;  or
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, (ii) gives us a reasonable root . However, (i)
&gt; gives us a weird result  . Why do I get this weird
&gt; result by square-rooting both sides?

You weird result is due to performing an **invalid** step and taking square root the incorrectly:  (Try  for example.)

Here are two correct solutions:

**Method A**

Continuing graphically:

.

**Method B**
(5-y)^2=(1-y)^2\\25-10y=1-2y\\.
