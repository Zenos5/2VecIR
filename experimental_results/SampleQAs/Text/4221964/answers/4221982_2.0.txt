The &quot;weird&quot; result doesn&#39;t depend on the manipulation you did but on the original equation itself.

Another way to solve it is by [zero-product property][1], that is:

A^2-B^2=(A+B)()=0 \iff  \,\lor\, =0

and in your equation the case  leds to no solution and we only keep the solution for the case .
