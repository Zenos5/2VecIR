@user already posted a good answer. However, I would like to add to it. The equation that you/I have posted is a simple/linear equation. It can only have one acceptable root/solution. If you attempt to solve the equation as you would for a quadratic equation, you get 2 roots, but one of the roots is unacceptable. So, you are left with only one acceptable root as it is a linear equation.
