As . Therefore,we need to check that  is divisible by  and 7.
 For divisibility by , by fermat&#39;s little theorem, n^=n\pmod  \implies {(n^)}^3.n=n^4\pmod =n^\pmod =n\pmod  \implies =0\pmod.
  For divisibility by 3, n^3=n\pmod 3\implies n^7=n^3\pmod 3=n\pmod 3 \implies =0\pmod 3. For divisibility by 7, n^7=n\pmod 7 \implies =0\pmod 7.  These relations implies that 4|().
