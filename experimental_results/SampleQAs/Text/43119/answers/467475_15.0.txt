Prime number are used in developing machine tools.  Utilizing primes you can avoid setting up harmonics which &quot;eat&quot; your very expensive tools.  Tools chatter, (bounce up and down), as they are being used.  Allowing those vibrations to propagate intensifying the chatter and the wear.

You ever wonder how the metal racks in a microwave get designed?  Again they use primes to assure that there are no harmonic possibilities, and you don&#39;t get the light show you would on an older microwave.
