Quadratic Reciprocity is stated in terms of the residues modulo primes.  This &quot;Golden Theorem&quot; as called by Gauss, is one of the main threads leading up to Langlands program and eventually to the geometric Langlands Program.  This later area of research has been shown to have ties with S-duality in string theory.  String theory is just now being proven useful in understanding phenomena in condensed matter physics.   Also it is the techniques that are used to prove results about prime numbers that have applications rather than a particular theorem about specific families of primes. 
Prime numbers are often test beds for more general results used in other areas of mathematics.
