You can use prime numbers to plot this fine pattern :)

Intensity of green colour for each pixel was calculated using a function, which can be described with this pseudocode snippet:

    g_intensity = ((((y &lt;&lt; 32) | x))^((x &lt;&lt; 32) | y))) * 15731 + 1376312589) % 256

where x and y are a pixel coordinates in screen space, stored in a 64bit integer variables.
