Call **** a  [stochastic matrix][] and denote with  one of its eigenpair.

Obviously  is an eigenvalue for , indeed follow directly from the definition of row-stochastic [column-stochastic] matrix that  =(\dots)^{T} is a right [left] eigenvector associated with .

Using [induced matrix norm][2] \parallel\parallel_{} or  ,  it&#39;s easy to prove that the spectral radius \rho()\leq  :


|\lambda|= \frac{|| x||}{||x||} \leq max_{||x||=} ||x||= ||||

Now, since ||||_{}  [respectively ||||_{\infty} ] is the maximum absolute column [row] sum of the matrix, we have 

||||_{}= if  is a column-stochastic matrix and
 
||||_{\infty}= if  is a row-stochastic matrix,

and then in any case |\lambda|\leq .
