Notice that,


\frac{\partial}{}\theta x^i = \frac{\partial}{}(\theta_0 + \theta_1x^i_1 + ... + \theta_jx^i_j)= 
in this  order derivative,  is a constant, so 
=\frac{\partial}{}(\theta_0 + \theta_1x^i_1 + ... + \theta_jx^i_j)=
because it is a linear model (), so
=(0 + x^i_1 + ... + x^i_j)=
=x^i_j
Finally,
\frac{\partial}{}\theta x^i = x^i_j
