I visualize the quotient space as a &quot;foliation&quot; of the space - think salad, but with rectilinear layers extending infinitely outwards - and in this case the layers of the foliation in  are cosets of the subspace . Geometrically, the cosets are just the space  shifted in any of the directions normal to it. For example, a line that goes through the origin in  is a subspace, to get the quotient we designate every line parallel to it in the plane as an element of the quotient, and we *parametrize* these layers by drawing a second, nonparallel line through the first at the origin, so that each point on the second line represents the layer it intersects in the plane. In order to add or scalar-multiply two layers, we simply do the associated vector operations on the subspace given by our second line!

You can do a similar geometry exercise in  with lines and planes. ith higher dimensions or more abstract spaces, we don&#39;t always have the luxury of a directly visualizable illustration, but I find the idea that we&#39;re cutting a space up into salad layers helpful all the same.
