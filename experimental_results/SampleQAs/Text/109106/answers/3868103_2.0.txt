You squash a subspace, call it L (it can be topological and algebraic for sure, but probably more types!), into a point, and this is the &quot;zero point&quot;.  

You then shift this linear subspace around the space to see what are the equivalence classes of each space, which is explained perfectly in Clive Newstead&#39;s paragraph 3.  Now, there is one important key to me that I might add to Clive&#39;s response is really just another way of saying that points in the quotient space are heavy as Clive said in paragraph 2.  It is that in the original space V (not it&#39;s subspace that you quotient by) that I mentioned earlier, points are literally things with no internal structure.  They are &quot;empty inside&quot;.  But when taking the quotient space, points become equivalence classes (look at cosets).  So every point in V is no longer alone and empty inside.  Now, inside, it has all the points that are equivalent to it.  So the internal structure of points of V is somehow increased by collapsing V via some nontrivial subset.

Points gaining information seems very much like massive pointlike particles.  Also, each point of V that is &quot;equivalent&quot; to some other point in V reflects some regulatory of the element, which is what particles experience as they pass through time.  Particles look the same over time for all we know.  Electrons&#39; shape doesn&#39;t change anywhere.  Every electron is identical to every other electron.  So choosing different &quot;coset representatives&quot; (eg: different points in V equivalent to each other in terms of how they differ the collapsed subspace L) is sort of like choosing the same particle at different moments in its timelike trajectory existence of General Relativity.

I am motivated by this way of conceptualizing quotient spaces because it seems to correlate with the foundations of physics in some sense...Point like particles get mass at the same instance that a timelike trajectory (which is a curvy line that is intuitively &quot;homeomorphic&quot; to a plain old coordinate dimension, say t, in spacetime) gets identified into a point.  (edit Nov 2021:) I&#39;ve actually come to think that it&#39;s kind of like how Schrodinger&#39;s equations describe a particle existing like a wave everywhere, but then it collapses to a point and that is probably the instance that mass is created and that the particle is moving.

We don&#39;t know how particles get mass in a solid geometry picture, and we don&#39;t know how time becomes moments that we see in this world.  A small enlarging and a big collapsing.  A quotient space.  The act of &quot;dividing by zero&quot;, or a timelike curve in 4d spacetime, creates motion of massive particles in a 3D space.  Also, I suspect that the orientation of integrals that define periods related to homology classes in the math world might say something about this &quot;holy grail&quot; of the quotient of spacetime by time, which in turn might say something about both inertia of massive bodies, and the direction of time.  

Just simple quotient spaces.  I don&#39;t see a clear picture of my ideas, but I know that quotient spaces bring some order to them.  It gives me a legitimate way of perceiving quotient spaces and builds intuition for questions that might be meaningful one day.
