Let&#39;s look at a simple eample. I&#39;ll take  and ; i.e  is the -ais inside the plane. What is /? On an algebraic level, it&#39;s the vector space of cosets of : i.e. I identif two points (,) and (&#39;, &#39;) if (,) - (&#39;,&#39;) \in . In our contet, this happens eactl when . So we are identifing all points that have a given -coordinate, and addition of cosets (,) +  is just adding the -coordinates. While it might be tempting to &lt;i&gt;identif&lt;/i&gt;  with the -ais, this is somewhat misleading, since this would lead ou to think that the quotient space / is a &lt;i&gt;subspace&lt;/i&gt; of , which it is not.
