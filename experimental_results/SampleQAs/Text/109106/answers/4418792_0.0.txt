In more detail, and sticking by the definition,

 =  iff 

In this setting, our groups are Abelian, so we can rewrite:

 iff 

We can choose  to be represented by the copy 

In this case that means that the difference  i.e., the two points are  in the same line through the origin
through the origin. This means the elements of the quotient are ( up to rotation) all the horizontal lines , or, equivalently, all parallel lines.
