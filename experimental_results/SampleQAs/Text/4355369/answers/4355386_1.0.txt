I partcular  s a ector space wth bass =\lbrace e_,e_2,e_3\rbrace called the caocal bass, where  s the ector of all the etres  except the  coordate whch hae a .

Ad as I tell  a more abstract sese ay ector  ca be wrtte as =\alpha_e_+\alpha_2e_2+\alpha_3e_3 but  egeerg texts the ectors e_,e_2,e_3 are deoted usually by ,j,k
