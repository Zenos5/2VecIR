Not sure of the exact hstor, but to m knowledge the conventon can be traced to the orgns of the complex numbers . Folk n the th centur were after solutons to cubc equatons, whch lead them to the msterous number , whch crucall s -dmensonal, but *appears* -dmensonal, n the sense that t les on the -axs (of course, understandng ths clears up an mster surroundng ). Snce  proved spectacularl successful n solvng cubcs, folk then took the natural step to generalse the algebrac structure  (a *feld* n modern parlance) to a wder settng of complex numbers called , wth the famlar notaton z=x+ and rules for addng and multplng the new numbers, whch ensure  s &quot;closed&quot; under these operatons. Ths means, for an z,u\n, z+u\n, \qquad zu\n.

Notce n ths form, complex numbers stll *feel* -dmensonal. Wllam Hamlton was one of the frst to succnctl state the geometrc sgnfcance of complex arthmetc, as the addton and multplcaton of *ordered pars of numbers*. Hamlton saw clearl that  s an algebra of D numbers, or *vectors*. Wth ths, he set out to dscover an equvalent algebra of ^3. It took about a decade before he realsed that ths was mpossble! *But* he made the marvelous dscover that, f ou gve up the dream of multplcatve commutatvt, ou can defne a *normed dvson algebra* for ^4, whch he called the *quaternons* . Ths dea was so brght Hamlton famousl carved ts germ onto a brdge when nspraton flashed upon hm durng a walk. The mage he carved n stone was an equaton \mathbf{}^=\mathbf{j}^=\mathbf{k}^=\mathbf{}\mathbf{j}\mathbf{k}=-.\tag{*} A quaternon s usuall wrtten n the form =a\mathbf{} +b\mathbf{}+c\mathbf{j}+d\mathbf{k}, where \mathbf{},\mathbf{},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k} are  \tmes complex matrces. Hence quaternon algebra s matrx alebgra. Snce  s unquel determned b four real numbers , we also have \n^4. From ths perspectve ^3 can be vewed as the subset of *pure magnar quaternons* a\mathbf{}+b\mathbf{j}+c\mathbf{k}. Vector arthmetc eventuall won out as the standard tool for ^3, but t would seem some of Hamlton&#39;s notaton wormed t&#39;s wa nto the theor. 

Lookng back, we can even see that the notaton for complex numbers z=x+ s an elegant form of matrx algebra z=x+=x\mathbf{}+\mathbf{}=x\begn{bmatrx} &amp; 0\\0 &amp;\end{bmatrx}+\begn{bmatrx}0 &amp; -\\ &amp; 0\end{bmatrx}=\begn{bmatrx}x &amp; -\\ &amp; x\end{bmatrx}.  So, f ou reall want, ou *can* vew what ou call the standard form as *addton between lke quanttes* as follows a\mathbf{}+b\mathbf{j}+c\mathbf{k}=a\begn{bmatrx}0 &amp; -\\ &amp; 0\end{bmatrx}+b\begn{bmatrx}0 &amp; -\\- &amp; 0\end{bmatrx}+c\begn{bmatrx} &amp; 0\\0&amp; -\end{bmatrx}=\begn{bmatrx}c &amp; -a-b\\a-b &amp; -c\end{bmatrx}.\tag{**} As a justfcaton for wh we mght want to do ths, t can be shown that, for an unt quaternon , the conjugaton map \mapsto ^{-} s a rotaton of ^3 when the  are taken as pure magnar quaterons.
