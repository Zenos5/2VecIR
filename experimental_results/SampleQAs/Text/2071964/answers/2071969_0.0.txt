No. Let 

 = \begin{bmatrix}  &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}

Then two right eigenvectors for  are e_ and , and two left eigenvectors for  are (\sqrt{2}/2) ( e_ \pm  ). When you put these into  and , the upper left corner of your product will not be the  identity.

I have a bad feeling this question&#39;s about to be edited to add the hypothesis that the eigenvalues be distinct...

When that happens, the answer will still be no, for if we permute the rows of  to form &#39; they&#39;ll still all be eigenvectors for , but the product  will undergo the same row permutation, so that even if  = I, we&#39;ll have &#39; \ne I.
