Here&#39;s a tentative proof that  is the inverse of . 

The left eigenvectors of  are the right eigenvectors of ^T. Therefore if =⋅Λ⋅^{-1} then ^T=^{-T}⋅Λ⋅^T which is an EVD. If the eigenvalues are distinct, the EVD is unique (up to scaling of eigenvectors), which proves that left eigenvectors are rows of ^{−1}, i.e. =^{-1}.

Of course the counterexamples below cast a dark shadow on this proof, but I can see nothing wrong with it.
