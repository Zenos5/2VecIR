Yes. This is true for any first order statement by Church&#39;s theorem, not just statements with respect to ZFC. First order logic is semidecidable, in that every first order statement that can be proven has a sound, complete proof calculus; Valid statements will always be decidable, and can always be proven, though this may take quite a bit of computation.

Satisfiability is undecidable in general however. If a statement is satisfiable, &lt;i&gt;sometimes&lt;/i&gt; it can be shown to be satisfiable with finite models, or forcing. If the statement itself and it&#39;s negation is demonstrably satisfiable, then you&#39;ve just proved the statement isn&#39;t a universally valid statement. However, one of the result&#39;s of Church&#39;s theorem proves that there&#39;s no algorithm that you can rely on to terminate trying to check for satisfiability of an arbitrary first order statement, because otherwise it would solve the Entscheidungsproblem.
