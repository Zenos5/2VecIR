Groups are symmetries. The best way to think about a group is that you have an object that has some kind of symmetry, and the group represents mathematically that symmetry. For example,  is the symmetry of a square, with each element representing a rotation of flip of the square;  is the symmetry of five objects rotating in a circle, with each element representing a different rotation; and  is the symmetry of  points that can be permuted in any fashion, with each element corresponding to a different reording.

In my opinion, this is far and away the best way to think about groups, even abstractly. You have some unspecified object and each element of the group represents a way that an object or collection of objects can be spun, flipped, reflected, etc. without changing.

See [here][1] for a cute interactive illustration of  being the symmetry group of a square.
