I always use the shorthad of  (the itegers) for ifiite order groups ad _ (remaiders mod ) for groups of order .

This is quite usefuls sice *ay cyclic group* is isomorphic to oe of these two.

This also gives a bit of sese *why* groups might be useful.

i.e. as a abstractio of the Itegers, allowig you to study groups (which are a less complicated object) istead of some complicated set (like the itegers with additio ad multiplicatio, complex umbers with additio, divisio, etc.).

You throw away the clutter, ad oly the essetial stuff remais.

Maybe it&#39;s ot as &quot;visual&quot; but it builds o the commo ituitios you have about the itegers. Ad I foud it quite helpful gettig through the &quot;basic&quot; theory, up to the poit where it gets iterestig. :)
