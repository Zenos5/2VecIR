I&#39;m having a hard time grasping groups in roup Theory. Is it okay to visualise them as being sets with the group axioms and a binary operation, intuitively as a Venn diagram? Also,  and  without  is really confusing me. I can&#39;t seem to move on in my study of roup Theory because of this. Can anyone also recommend me any online sources for a clear understanding of groups, please? What are some applications of groups? How can I apply them and see them to better understand their purpose. I feel really anxious whenever I open my textbook on roup Theory and it&#39;s because of these answers that I&#39;m missing. I&#39;ve looked through countless books and online notes. Everything is seems too complex and doesn&#39;t sit in my mind. I would love to study this subject more effectively. I had this problem while studying Set Theory and I need another approach for roup Theory. Thank you!
