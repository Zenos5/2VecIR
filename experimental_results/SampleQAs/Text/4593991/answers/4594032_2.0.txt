Observe  implies that,  

Thus, under the restriction  we have:

\begin{align}x\sqrt{1-x^2}&amp;=\sqrt{1-x^2}-x\\
\left(x\sqrt {1-x^2}\right)^2&amp;=1-2x\sqrt {1-x^2}\end{align}


Letting , we have:

\begin{align}&amp;u^2=1-2u\\
\implies &amp;u^2+2u-1=0\end{align}

This leads to:

\begin{align}&amp;u=\sqrt{1-x^2}-x\\
\implies &amp;ux=u-x^2,\,xâ‰ 0\\
\implies &amp;x^2+ux-u=0.\end{align}

Finally, note that all possible roots of the original equation must satisfy the inequality .
