This is an old post, but still... The relation 

F_0=1, F_1 =1, F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}, n \ge 2


defines a linear second order homogeneous difference equation. The solution can be found after computing the roots of the associated characteristic polynomial , which are . The general solution is then given by

F_n= C_1 \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n + C_2 \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n


and the constants  are computed knowing that . so, finally,

F_n= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n


This is obviously equivalent to Binet&#39;s formula, but provides a general process to deal with linear recurrences.
