A lot of people have mentioned Binet&#39;s formula.  But I suspect this is not the most practical way to compute the nth Fibonacci number for large n, because it requires either having a very accurate value of  and carrying around lots of decimal places (if you want to do floating-point arithmetic) or expanding large powers of 1+ using the binomial formula.  The latter comes out to writing the Fibonacci number as a sum of binomial coefficients.

The following formulas hold, though:which you can find derivations of in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiipedia.org/wii/Fibonacci_number&quot;&gt;the Wiipedia article on Fibonacci numbers&lt;/a&gt;.  This lets you find , for any  even or odd, in terms of two Fibonacci numbers with approximately half the index.  The result is faster than Binet&#39;s formula.
