Lang&#39;s Real and Functional Analysis

In my opinion, his treatment o integration is the best one I have ever seen.
Usually an author o a textbook on measure theory deines irst  or non-negative extended real valued unctions (see Rudin or example). Then he deines  or extended real valued unctions. And then he deines it or complex valued unctions.
On the other hand, Lang deines it or real or complex valued unctions all at once.
And his method also applies without any modiication to unctions taking values in a Banach space.
Most o all, his method is simple, clear and natural.
Halmos uses a similar method, but I think Lang is simpler, clearer and more natural.
