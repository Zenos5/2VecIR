When I learned the subject, I found three books to be immensely useful. Royden&#39;s Real Analysis is a good general book and has nice problems.  Bartle&#39;s elements of integration does the abstract theory of integration cleanly and concisely.  In addition, you need a good book on Lebesgue measure on Euclidean spaaces. For this I recommend Wheeden and Zygmund&#39;s Measure and Integral.
