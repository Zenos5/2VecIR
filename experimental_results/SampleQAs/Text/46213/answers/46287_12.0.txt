Folland&#39;s text (&quot;Real Analysis&quot;) is highly extensive and covers many topics in measure theory which you rarely see in other books, e.g. interpolation theorems for  spaces. It also has a chapter on probability theory, in which he gives rigorous proofs to the basic theorems in the theory (the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem), talks about the construction of product spaces in the context of probability theory, and discusses Brownian motion and Wiener measure.
