Schilling was my introduction to the subject too. There are a few misprints, but a lot of them are corrected in the errata.

I&#39;ve found Rudin&#39;s Real and Complex Analysis useful as a reference / second text. You could also take a look at [Folland&#39;s Real Analysis][1]. Terry Tao has notes about the subject on his blog, see [here][2].

One of the most comprehensive books, besides Kallenberg&#39;s Foundations of Modern Probability, is probably [Bogachev&#39;s Measure Theory][3] (2-volumes). Its Table of Contents can be viewed [at Springer][4].
