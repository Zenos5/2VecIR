***Textbook***: *Real ad Complex Aalysis* by Walter Rudi

***Explaatio***: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 ad 8 costitute a excellet geeral treatmet of measure theory. Let me elaborate:

**Chapter 1**: The otios of a abtract measure space ad a abstract topological space are itroduced ad studied i cocurrece. This treatmet allows the reader to see the close coectios betwee the two subjects that appear both i practice ad i theory. Elemetary examples ad properties of measurable fuctios ad measures are discussed. Furthermore, Lebesgue&#39;s mootoe covergece theorem, Fatou&#39;s lemma, ad Lebesgue&#39;s domiated covergece theorem are prove i this chapter. Fially, the chapter discusses cosequeces of these results. The elegace of the treatmet allows the reader to quickly become accustomed to the basic theory of measure. 

**Chapter 2**: This chapter delves further ito the itimate coectio betwee topological ad measure theoretic otios. More specifically, the chapter begis with a treatmet of some importat results i geeral topology such as Urysoh&#39;s lemma ad the costructio of partitios of uity. Afterwards, these results are applied to establish the Riesz represetatio theorem for positive liear fuctioals. The proof of this result is log but is oetheless carefully broke ito small steps ad the reader should fid little or o difficulty i uderstadig each of these steps. The Riesz represetatio theorem is applied i a particularly elegat maer to the theory of positive Borel measures. Fially, the existece ad basic properties of the Lebesgue measure are show to be a virtually trivial cosequece of the Riesz represetatio theorem. The chapter eds with a ice set of exercises that discusses, i particular, some iterestig couterexamples i measure theory.

**Chapter 3**: The basic theory of  spaces () is itroduced. The chapter begis with a elemetary treatmet of covex fuctios. Rudi explais that may elemetary iequalities i aalysis may be established as easy cosequeces of the theory of covex fuctios ad evidece is provided for this claim. I particular, Holder&#39;s ad Mikowski&#39;s iequalities are prove. These results culmiate i the proof that the  spaces are ideed complex vector spaces. The completeess of the  spaces ad various importat desity results are also discussed. 

**Chapter 6**: This chapter discusses the theory of complex measures, ad i particular, the Rado-Nikodym theorem. Vo Neuma&#39;s proof of the Rado-Nikodym theorem is preseted ad various cosequeces are discussed ragig from the characterizatio of the dual of the  spaces () to the Hah decompositio theorem. These results culmiate i the proof of the Riesz represetatio theorem for bouded liear fuctios. A kowledge of chapters  ad  are ecessary i this chapter although they do ot strictly cover measure theory. Uiform itegrability ad the Vitali covergece theorem are treated i the exercises at the ed of the chapter.

**Chapter 7**: The mai topic of this chapter is Fubii&#39;s theorem. A wealth of ice couterexamples is discussed ad a importat applicatio is preseted: the result that the covolutio of two fuctios i  is agai i . A woderful feature of this treatmet is the geerality; the result is established i oe of the most geeral forms possible.

**Chapter 8**: This chapter treats differetiatio of measures ad the Hardy-Littlewood maximal fuctio which is a importat tool i aalysis. A umber of applicatios are preseted ragig from a proof of the chage of variables theorem i Euclidea -space (i a very geeral form) to a treatmet of fuctios of bouded variatio ad absolute cotiuity. Several results from this chapter are also used later i this book; most otable is the use of the differetiatio theorem of measures i the study of of harmoic fuctios i chapter 11.

Let me summarize with some geeral commets regardig the book:

***Prerequisites***: A good kowledge of set-theoretic otios, cotiuity ad compactess suffice for the chapters that I have described. A at least rudimetary kowledge of differetiatio ad uiform covergece is very helpful at times. Oe eed ot be acquiated with *the theory of the Riema itegral* beforehad although oe should at least be acquiated with its computatio. I short, a kowledge of chapters 1, 2, 3,  ad 7 of Rudi&#39;s earlier book *Priciples of Mathematical Aalysis* is advisable before oe reads this textbook.

***Exercises***: The exercises i this textbook are woderful. May of the exercises build a ituitio of the theory ad applicatios treated i the text ad therefore it is advisable to do as may exercises as possible. However, you should expect to work to solve a few of the exercises. A umber of importat cocepts such as covergece i measure, uiform itegrability, poits of desity, Mikowski&#39;s iequality for covolutio, iclusios betwee  spaces, Hardy&#39;s iequality etc. are treated i the exercises. However, if you are truly stuck you will fid that may of these results are either theorems or exercises with detailed hits i other textbooks. (E.g., Follad&#39;s *Real Aalysis*.)

***Cotet***: I have already described the cotet i some detail but let me say that the cotet is about exactly what oe eeds to study braches of mathematics where measure theory is applied. Of course, this is with the assumptio that oe at least attempts as may exercises as possible sice a umber of importat results (from probability theory, for example) are treated i the exercises. 

***Style***: The proofs i Rudi are (with possibly mior exceptios) complete. Ulike a umber of other mathematics textbooks, Rudi prefers ot to leave ay parts of proofs to the reader ad istead focusses o givig the reader o-trivial exercises as practice at the ed of each chapter. The book reads magificetly ad the flow of results is excellet; almost all results are stated i cotext. It is fair to say that the *mai text of the book* lacks examples, which is perhaps oe of the oly poits of complaits by studets, but the *exercises do cotai examples*. Fially, the book is rigorous ad is completely free of mathematical errors.

I hope this review of Rudi&#39;s *Real ad Complex Aalysis* is helpful! I have read virtually the etire book (over  moths) ad I foud it to be oe of the most ejoyable experieces of my life. It really motivated me to delve deeper ito aalysis. Perhaps the same will be true for you. I certaily recommed this book with my deepest ethusiasm.
