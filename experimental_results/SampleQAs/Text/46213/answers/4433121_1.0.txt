I found the book [Measure, Integration &amp; Real Analysis][1] by Sheldon Axler an excellent read.

 - The book motivates definitions with examples and counterexamples. 
 - The book highlights the important parts so that you can peruse it.
 - There are good end-of-chapter problems that drive in the concept learnt.

Axler brings a similar style to his more famous Linear Algebra book to the area of Measure Theory. The book is an easy read while being rigorous.

The book is aimed at active learning and may not be a comprehensive reference book (as requested in the question). Having said that, it provides excellent proofs, motivates definitions well and has a good topic coverage. It also helps that the author has made the book available on open access.
