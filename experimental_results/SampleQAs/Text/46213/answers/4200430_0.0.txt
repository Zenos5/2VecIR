I suggest the following books:

**The classical books**
------------------------
1- S. J. Taylor, Introduction to Measure and Integration, Cambridge University Press, 1973. (*Very constructive book -may be hard-, personally, I use this book for abstract measure theory as a textbook*)

2- E. Asplund and L. Bungart, A First Course in Integration, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1966. (*It is very useful to understand Lebesgue&#39;s Integral and Measure theory on reals*.)


**Modern Books:**
--------------
3- F. Burk, Lebesgue Measure and Integration: An Introduction, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (my second recommended textbook)

4- F. Jones, Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean, Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2001. 


5- G. S. Nelson, A User-Friendly Introduction to Lebesgue Measure and Integration,  AMS, 2015. (*Easy to understand, excellent for beginners, Recommended.*)

6- W. Johnston, The Lebesgue Integral for Undergraduates, MAA Press 2nd ed 2015. (*Easy to understand, excellent for beginners, Recommended.*)

7- J. Yeh, PROBLEMS AND PROOFS IN REAL ANALYSIS: Theory of Measure and Integration, World Scientific 2014. (*Good collection of exercises but you need to learn first*)
 

**General and interesting books are:**

1- F. Burk, A Garden of Integrals, MAA, 2007. (*I like this book and I recommend reading this book at first*)

2- D. M. Bressoud, A Radical Approach to Lebesgue&#39;s Theory of Integration, Cambridge University Press, 2008.
